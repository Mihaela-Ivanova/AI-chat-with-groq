# 🤖 Chat AI with Groq API
🚀 In this project, you’ll bring artificial intelligence to life by creating a chatbot powered by the Groq API. This chatbot will respond to user messages in real time using advanced AI models! Instead of a graphical interface, we’re keeping it sleek and console-based—just like real-world API integrations. 🚀

# 🎯 Project goal
In this project, a chat application will be created that uses the Groq API to generate AI responses. 
The code will run directly in the IDE and display the responses in the console. Let's dive in! 🚀

# 💻 Skills
This project is an exciting way to improve coding skills and learn API integration! Be creative and have fun! 🎉
