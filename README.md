# 🤖 Chat AI with Groq API

✈️ In this project, you will bring artificial intelligence to life by creating a chatbot powered by the Groq API. This chatbot will respond to user messages in real time using advanced AI models! Instead of a GUI, we keep it sleek and console-based - just like real-world API integrations.

# 🎯 Project Goal

In this project, you will create a chat application that uses the Groq API to generate AI responses to various questions entered by the user. The code will run directly in the IDE and display the responses in the console.
The project is designed to be usable in multiple languages. Let's dive in! 🚀

# 💻 Skills

🎉 This project is an exciting way to improve your coding skills and learn API integration! Be creative and have fun! 🎉
